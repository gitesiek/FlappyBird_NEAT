# FlappyBird_NEAT

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Flappy Bird, with an added twist â€“ it utilizes the NEAT algorithm for evolutionary neural network training.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gitesiek/FlappyBird_NEAT.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the game**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## What you can do

1. **Play the game**  
    When black screen shows up just press 'P' key and play the game using spacebar to flop the birds wings
2. **Train your own generations**  
    If you don't feel like playing the game yourself you can press 'A' key when black screen shows up and see how your computer teaches itself to play the game
3. **Watch as AI plays the game**  
    By pressing 'A' and then 'L' you can use my pre-trained model and watch it earn unbelievable scores :)
